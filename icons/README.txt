ICON PLACEHOLDERS

You need to create or obtain the following icon files for your extension:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons will be used in various places in Chrome:
- The extension toolbar
- The Chrome extensions page
- The Chrome Web Store (if you publish there)

For a proper extension, you should replace these placeholder instructions with actual icon files.

Suggested icon design:
- A recognizable symbol for video or playback (play button, video camera, etc.)
- X/Twitter branding colors (blue #1DA1F2)
- Simple and recognizable at small sizes

You can create these icons using:
- Graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or free alternatives like GIMP
- Online icon generators
- Icon packs (make sure you have the right to use them)
